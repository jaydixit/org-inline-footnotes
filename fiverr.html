<h2 id="sec-1">Alice&rsquo;s dream</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &lsquo;and what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without pictures or conversation?&rsquo; <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> <br  />

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">The Rabbit</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> <br  />
</p>

<p>
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> <br  />
